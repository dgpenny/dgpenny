<h1>Educating Liberals (Dylan) July 8, 2020</h1>
<p>DANG ALL MIGHTY this is SPOT ON. <br>
  I have been singing this tune for several years now. Free energy, no more fiat currency, we are at WAR with an enemy you proudly pay your taxes to and 
  fill your tanks with their crude oil. <br><br>

READ THIS <br><br>

"President Trump authorized the US Treasury to take control over the Federal Reserve. This is easily one of the biggest news stories in the last 100 years, <br>
  yet many are completely unaware of it, because it was not reported in any real way on mainstream news outlets. Many know that the Fed is not a government agency,<br> 
  but a privately owned banking cartel, which in 1913 instituted a monetary system in which their currency, unlinked to any hard assets like gold, was loaned into<br> 
  existence at interest to governments, and by extension their citizens. They came quietly in the night, and usurped the power of money away from We the People.<br><br>

The first dollar was indeed loaned into existence, but more than a dollar required in return payment. Thus, by its very model, government debt could never be repaid,<br> 
  since not enough money exists to repay it. More money can only be borrowed into existence to service the interest payments on the existing debt, while creating more<br> 
  of said debt. The majority of funds collected by the IRS go to servicing the interest on debts to the Fed and not to any public utilities. In this respect,<br> 
  the Fed has more power than the US Government which it loans its money to. But not any more.<br><br>

The Trump Alliance is far bigger than simply one US President, though Donald Trump is easily one of our greatest, on par with Washington and Lincoln. One day,<br> 
  he will be up on Mount Rushmore, and those who did not understand what he stood for while all this was actually happening can explain to the next generation <br>
  the mind control aspects of popular media and how, unfortunately, it also worked on them.<br><br>

Because every day it gets more obvious, as people from all walks of life break through the noise of those who might rule us, and discover the story that is playing<br> 
  out on the world stage. The true definition of Apocalypse, after all, is not the destruction of the world, but an unveiling or unfolding of things not previously<br> 
  known and which could not be known apart from the unveiling.<br><br>

We have entered the unveiling stage of world history. To those who wish to know, all information is available on virtually every subject right at your fingertips,<br> 
  if you can get past the entertainment media complex, which is owned by 6 corporations, the members of which are all on each other's boards and the boards of the<br> 
  international banking conglomerate, upon which the Fed sat like a crown jewel. But crown jewels ain't what they used to be. And in this Apocalypse all historical<br> 
  Titans must fall. A new world will not be birthed via the control mechanisms of the old. That means the Medical Cartels & Big Pharma must fall. Illness-for-profit<br> 
  is the name of their game.<br><br>

Diseases can be, and sometimes are, created in labs and afterwards the non-cures promoted to the population. These non-cures keep the disease in a holding pattern <br>l
  long enough to extract maximum profit. After all, there is no profit in cheaply curing any disease.<br><br>

In order for the people to know they must be shown, beyond any and all doubt. For most, telling alone will not be enough. I write these posts chiefly for posterity.<br> 
  For those deeply ensconced in the anti-Trump world, no words will ever be enough. No article or news story will ever meet their standards of validity, and<br> 
  as long as they can still palm off everything they don't like or agree with as conspiracy, they will continue to do so. What is at stake are their well-cultivated<br> 
  illusions, upon which their cherished anti-Trump beliefs are cemented in media-justified intellectual certainty.<br><br>

Trump is an ignorant racist buffoon and his followers are morons. These truths must be self evident if Jimmy Kimmel & Bill Maher repeat them every night on TV.<br> 
  But the TV has rarely been a fountain of truth when real power is at stake. You can detonate buildings in front of some people and they will believe it when you <br>
  tell them it was hijacked planes.Even the building that no planes hit, that was from hijacked planes, too. The laws of physics mean nothing when you have been brainwashed<br> 
  by the media and have Stockholm Syndrome for those who have historically led you around by the nose. In a way, we are all still sitting inside the prison of an old history. <br>
  The doors are open, however, and nothing stops us from leaving except our own hesitation regarding what might lay on the other side. True, there are yet some of <br>
  the old guard left, wardens telling us we may not leave, that they are still in charge of us.<br><br>

But the sun is bright in the meadows outside the prison gates, the birds beckoning us forward with song. The prison might have fed us and housed us for longer <br>
  than we care to remember, but we were never truly free while in its confines. What awaits on the other side of this historical moment is true freedom. It is<br> 
  the promise at the end of history's story. 5,000+ energy patents have been shelved for 'national security reasons' over the last 70 years. Nikola Tesla was<br> 
  one of the great geniuses of history and yet the majority of his work was suppressed.<br><br>

Did you know Donald Trump's favorite uncle John Trump went to MIT with Tesla and they worked together, having a shared interest in particle acceleration? Did you know<br> 
  John Trump inherited the notes of Tesla upon his death? Those notes went into the right hands. Energy is one big piece of the puzzle, but first we must start with<br> 
  banking. This the golden rule: that those with the gold make the rules. Can you imagine what the world would be like if Good instead of Evil was actually in charge?<br><br>

The Federal Reserve will be forced to swallow its own debt and the US Treasury will institute a new gold backed currency from the ashes of the dying Fed. <br><br>
  The first step has already been taken for this, with many other steps concurrently behind the scenes. When it is launched it will seem as if it happened overnight.<br>
  The old petrol-based energy technologies will then be replaced by a release of new energy tech that will make our current alternative energies look like <br>
  children's toys. One of the (very many) reasons Space Force was instituted was to mine products such as Helium 3 from the moon. It is an extraordinarily rare<br> 
  element on earth, but exists in far greater supply on the moon. A pound of it is worth over a billion dollars. The reason why is that it can be utilized in nuclear fusion.<br>
  We currently utilize nuclear fission, splitting uranium atoms to produce steam which powers turbines to create electricity. The problem is that the end product is very <br>
  dangerous nuclear waste. With nuclear fusion via Helium 3, the end product is organic and harmless.<br><br>

But you thought Trump was just a big goofball instituting Space Force, didn't you? Just another goofy moron who keeps outsmarting the most entrenched and powerful <br>
  cartels the world has ever known at each and every turn. And yes, Covid19 was created and released to counter the freedom fighters of the Trump Alliance and to <br>
  stop the inevitable awakening of humanity on Earth. The plan was discovered and largely mitigated, though there has been obvious fall out.<br><br>

And no, they don't get to lock down the world indefinitely and inject us all with their Gates vaccine. Their plans will be used against them. The whole world is <br>
  watching and they will be unmasked for all to see. Many already do see, quite clearly, but there are just as many still entranced by the spell of Hollywood & <br>
  the Media. They thought we would all follow the stars. We may follow the north star, and light our way at night by the glimmer of constellations, but the <br>
  bought-and-sold 'stars' of Hollywood have never had less value. Most of them report to those who gave them their stardom, their 'special job' of prominence, <br>
  and as such, that is where their allegiances can be found, even when those allegiances run counter to the benefit of humanity. <br><br>
  
  Define sell-out. Define rationalization. There are notable exceptions, of course, and you can't knock someone for wanting to work in a creative field like <br>
  the arts. However, there is no excuse for steering the public wrong at such a critical juncture. And those that do are the chaff and not the wheat of this harvest.<br> 
  They should change their tunes while they still have the chance.<br><br>

An Anon once said in regard to what Trump faces: "What's the most difficult thing in your life? Multiply that times a billion. Now try to fix that problem on a <br>
  public stage with thousands of brilliant psychopathic adversaries working against you." Eventually all will come to realize that a Divine Providence has guided <br>
  the Trump Alliance's quest to rid the world of the death cult control of the old guard and free humanity. Trump is a true hero of the American People, and by <br>
  extension, the entire World. Some see it now. Some will see it later. But eventually it will be a well established permanent truth.<br><br>

You can tell the difference by what they promote. Trump has promoted Hydroxychloroquine. It is a generic drug that costs 63 cents. He has no stake in it, beyond the<br> 
  fact that it works, and for much more than just Covid. His opponents promote a thousand dollar pill that they own. And they promote a vaccine with medical chip <br>
  tracking. These are the same people that believe there are too many humans on Earth and we need to reduce the numbers. They're so in-your-face obvious about their<br> 
  plans at this point they might as well be wearing Dr. Evil costumes. This is what I mean when I say that people cannot be told, they must be shown.<br><br>

If you haven't figured out at this point that they put things in vaccines that are not radiant products of health-promoting vitality, then you are simply not paying<br> 
  attention. And this is a bad time to be not paying attention. Therefore, the stage play will get more and more obvious until all but the most blind can see it.<br><br>

Right now we still have a great many well-meaning people advocating for their oppressors and battling against the Trump Alliance. That very Alliance which is <br>
  opening the gates of our metaphoric jails and smashing down the prison walls. But you can't be forced out of your individual cell. Freewill is still paramount. <br>
  While it is true that the Titans are going down whether they like it or not (and they most certainly do not like it) each individual must decide for themselves <br>
  how to interpret events and proceed forward on their own two feet.<br><br>

What awaits us? Trump himself told us in his inaugural address. "The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action...<br><br>

We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, <br>
  industries and technologies of tomorrow." In order to unlock these technologies and free the Earth from disease, those that controlled the technologies and hid <br>
  the cures from us must be comprehensively defeated. And make no mistake, we are here to defeat them, absolutely and at every level.<br><br>

And when we are done there will be nothing left of their 'new world order' power structure. It was never the new world order anyway, it was the old, and it has <br>
  literally no chance of maintaining its structure in the reality of the increasing light upon the planet.<br><br>

The Aboriginals, the Natives, the great seers from the past, they knew this time was coming. And none of us are here today by accident. At one level or another, <br>
  you signed up for this time, and chose to be here now. It's a heck of a wave to surf, but it will take us to a far better shore, one we can only imagine from our <br>
  current vantage point. It's promise is worth whatever it takes to get there. In the end, it is only the ghosts of the past we leave behind.<br><br>

As light increases, frequencies change. As light increases, what was once hidden is revealed. Again, the true meaning of Apocalypse. This is the Apocalypse for the <br>
  old world order. As more of the public awakens, their control continues to slip. They will fight every step of the way, but they cannot stop what is coming, or <br>
  hide what is being revealed. So ask yourself what side of history you'd like to be on as this final series of curtains are pulled back, one after the other.
Do you still wish that somehow Trump will be stopped? You will not get your wish.<br><br>

If you stand for the freedom of humanity to live in a world that supports their true health and well-being, you might ask to be shown the actual truth, <br>
  hidden behind all those curtains, instead of the pretty little lies promoted by those that would control you with their banks, their medical cartels, and their <br>
  old energy technology. Do not be fooled by their claims to love the environment. They are heavily invested in oil and gas. Do not be fooled by their claims <br>
  to love health care. They are heavily invested in the corrupt pharmaceutical industry. Do not be fooled by their claims to support prosperity. They foisted their <br>
  banking system on us on Christmas Eve, 1913.<br><br>

And sunk the Titanic beforehand to take out the 3 major bankers who were against their plan. That's how little they care about any lives lost in the fallout of <br>
  their schemes. Did Hollywood tell you about that story? No, it gave you a fictional tale of a lost diamond and a touching little love story about a floating hunk <br>
  of wood with room for only one.<br><br>

But something else also happened once upon a Christmas Eve. A rag-tag band of freedom loving Patriots crossed the semi-frozen Delaware and hiked 9 miles in a <br>
  blizzard to take on the most powerful empire on Earth. Their chance of victory in this war of Revolution, by any mathematical calculation, hovered right around <br>
  zero percent. But as Washington himself said:<br>

"The Man must be bad indeed who can look upon the events of the American Revolution without feeling the warmest gratitude towards the great <br>
  Author of the Universe whose divine interposition was so frequently manifested in our behalf.”<br><br>

Do not bet against President Trump and the Trump Alliance. Divine Providence guides them, like Washington and his Continental Army, in this battle. No one can <br>
  tell the exact time frames while we are still in the story, but the route itself is inexorable. The Titan known as the Federal Reserve was taken down, quietly, <br>
  overnight, with a single hit from a slingshot.<br><br>

What is next? When Trump mentioned that light can be used as a disinfectant for diseases in the body, did you make fun of him or choose to look into that technology?<br>
  The choice, as ever, is yours. The path of ignorance or enlightenment. Both are difficult in their own ways, but only one gets to a place worth getting to.<br><br>

When light dawns, people awaken. When light dawns, darkness disappears. Darkness and its progenitors had their time for historical rule. There was a genius in their <br>
  darkness and their methods of control. But when the time is up, the time is up. You don't bet against cycles whose imprimatur predates the plans of any and all <br>
  mice and men.<br><br>

And do not bet against Donald Trump or the Alliance that supports him. The best is truly yet to come. Where we go one, we go all.</p>
